            <p>I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Economics at the University of Hawaii-Manoa, 
                where I am also a teaching assistant. I previously earned my MA in International Relations from the Graduate School
                of Asia-Pacific Studies (GSAPS) at Waseda University in 2022. I also previously worked as a research assistant for the 
                Waseda Institute of Digital Government. Before pursuing my graduate degrees, I was an associate examiner for the U.S. Farm Credit Administration.</p>

            <p>My niche involves the intersection of East Asian
                Studies and Economics. My fields of interest are development economics, 
                political economy, experimental economics (both field and laboratory), 
                and applied microeconomics, particularly in East and Southeast Asia.

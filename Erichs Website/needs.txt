I previously earned my MA in International Relations from the Graduate School of Asia-Pacific Studies (GSAPS) at Waseda University in 2022. I also previously worked as a research assistant for the Waseda Institute of Digital Government. Before pursuing my graduate degrees I was an associate examiner for the U.S. Farm Credit Administration.
